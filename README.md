## NEMPay

**NEMPay at the moment only works in the test net**. MainNet version will be released soon.

NEMPay is an app developed by Atraura Blockchain to transfer assets in an easy way, directly from mobile devices, using NEM Blockchain.  Just selecting the asset to be sent from your balance, typing recipient address and amount to be sent, you can make a quick transaction in just few seconds.

Currently, the app is available for Android and iOS.

### Customizations

Companies and individuals can take advantage of NEMPay  as a boilerplate to create their NEM application.

A common user case would be create an app for their own mosaic and namespace. The cost of acquisition it is lower, as there is no need to code a new app. 

You can contact david@atraura.com for a budget.
